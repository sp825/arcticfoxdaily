                    <img src="totopic%20(13)_JPG.jpg" alt="pic-of-toto" width="250" height="230">
                    <p>
                    Toto was primarily a "hands-off" fox, and didn't usually prefer physical attention. 
                     However, in his older years, he started to not mind the occasional love-scratch here and there. 
                     Even so, he and I had an incredible, unspoken bond. He was the catalyst to what we are today. 
                     I will miss him dearly and forever be thankful for what he taught me. <i><b>2012-2022</b></i>

                    Kaya is a Red fox who came in as a wildlife rehabilitation intake (the goal with those intakes is always release back into the wild). 
                    She was deemed non-releasable by one of our vets, because of her strangely calm demeanor around humans. 
                    She lacked a fear of humans that would leave her safe in the wild.

                    <p>
                    Porsha has a fun, youthful personality, and she goes between super sassy to super loving in seconds. 
                    She's a great example of why it's so important to be able to recognize and be familiar with body language when working with foxes. 
                    She's a very comical fox!

                    <p>
                    He was very well-loved by his previous owners, and he primarily lived in their house. He was used as an exhibition animal for a few years, as his previous family had a small business where they traveled with exotic species that they owned. 
                    They had legally owned Loki under a USDA Exhibitor's license. 
                    Once further NYS regulations were released for certain species, they were unable to obtain the new license now required to own a fox in NYS.

                    <img src="moripic.jpg" alt="pic-of-mori" width="200" height="200">
                    <p>
                    Mori was an exhibit animal at a zoo, and due to his timid temperament, it was too stressful of an environment for him. 
                    He is going to do much better in a sanctuary environment like ours, where exposure to the public is extremely limited
